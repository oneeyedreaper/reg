						<h1>OUR INSPIRATION</h1>

						<h5>Abraham Lincoln's letter to his son's headmaster</h5>
						<br />

						<p>
							"My son will have to learn I know, that all men are not just, all
							men are not true. But teach him that for every scoundrel there is
							a hero; that for every selfish politician, there is a dedicated
							leader. Teach him that for every enemy there is a friend. It will
							take time, I know, but teach him, if you can, that a dollar earned
							is of far more value than five found. Teach him to learn to lose
							and also to enjoy winning. Steer him away from envy, if you can.
							Teach him the secret of quiet laughter. Let him learn early that
							the bullies are the easiest to lick. Teach him, if you can, the
							wonder of books... but also give him quiet time to ponder over the
							eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun and flowers
							on a green hill side. In school teach him it is far more honorable
							to fail than to cheat. Teach him to have faith in his own ideas,
							even if everyone tells him they are wrong. Teach him to be gentle
							with gentle people and tough with the tough. Try to give my son
							the strength not to follow the crowd when everyone is getting on
							the band wagon. Teach him to listen to all men. But teach him also
							to filter all the hears on a screen of truth and take only the
							good that comes through. Teach him, if you can, how to laugh when
							he is sad. Teach him there is no shame in tears. Teach him to
							scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness.Teach him to
							sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders; but never to put
							a price tag on his heart and soul. Teach him to close his ears to
							a howling mob... and to stand and fight if he thinks he is right.
							Treat him gently; but do not cuddle him because only the test of
							fire makes fine steel. Let him have the courage to be impatient,
							let him have the patience to be brave. Teach him always to have
							the sublime faith in himself because then he will always have the
							sublime faith in mankind.This is a big order, but see what you can
							do... He is such a fine little fellow, my son". This great man's
							vision is an inspiration for us.

										They also share feedback with students to help them improve
										their learning strategies and study habits in order to
										become more independent and successful learners. The purpose
										of the assessment by the faculty members is continuous
										monitoring of students learning and revisions, when
										necessary and possible. Whatever the faculty members observe
										in students during their assessment, they register the
										observation, and make required modifications and implement
										this quickly in their academic delivery.
